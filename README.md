# Expedia Demo
Example of the main section of Expedia (navbar, icons and search bar.)
## Vision
Recreate the main section of expedia with the navbar, the icons and a search bar.
### Guidelines of the page:
- must be responsive;
- use framework (bootstrap, ecc);
- use icons;
- use a google font;
- images without copywright;
- dynamic section (nice to have)

### Section finished and it is:
- responsive
- I use Bootstrap (CDN min.css) just to place some elements and then I use only flexbox property;
- I use icons from Fontawesome https://fontawesome.com;
- I use Inter font https://rsms.me/inter/ :
    - Google research:   https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter;
